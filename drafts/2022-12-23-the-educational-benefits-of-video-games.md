Video games are a relatively new form of media and have been popular amongst the general population since their inception - especially with the youth. The problems often associated with video games include desensitisation, encourages antisocial behaviours and is seen as a source of distraction for individuals. Despite these negative connotations, several studies indicate they can foster a wide range of cognitive abilities, motivate, increase well-being and give immediate rewards. They are also fun in nature and interactive contrasting other embodiments of media. Many of its positive attributes give the video game its educational potential.

Cognitive skills may develop from playing video games, including shooter games. A study created by Green (2006) shows that shooter games compared to other types of game genres boost brain power in those who have never played or have little experience with these action games. Skills such as more accurate attention allocation, improved hand-eye coordination, and even better vision can be seen in gamers compared to non-gamers. Bavelier, Green’s lab partner, also spoke about this in her TED talk, “Your brain on video games.” She states that despite conventional beliefs that video games can ruin the eyes and they can dumb people down, research says that they can actually boost brain power and even improve vision, which are some of the catalysts for learning.

Video game fixation has seen an increase during the past decade or so. Which has been a cause of worry for many people. It isn’t necessarily a bad thing because this shows it can be a great motivator in school settings. Games also incorporate play and fun, which may lead to greater intrinsic motivation in an individual. Play, fun and autonomy are great boosters of productivity and quality according to many motivation studies in real-life settings. It can be seen in The Research Findings Report (2011) by the state government of Victoria. This report trialled three types of video games - serious games, virtual worlds (Quest Atlantis), and puzzle games - on primary and secondary students across Victoria. They found in all three strands, students were more cooperative and motivated to learn. It demonstrates the integration of video games in education systems can help amplify motivation in learning.

One archetypal image of a gamer is a person hunched in front of a screen all day and never goes outside to socialise. Yet, video games are a common pastime for the masses. If video games are frequent in many people’s lives then surely it will be a great topic to include in conversations with friends, colleagues or even strangers. School - as well as a place for gaining knowledge - is a place for socialisation. Information can be passed from one person to another even when unaware. The research report by the state government of Victoria shows that there has been an increase in collaboration amongst peers after the introduction of video games in their curriculum. Video games have social benefits which can also be helpful exchanging information with peers.

Several researchers use video games to measure abilities, self-esteem and many more to help them with their experiments. They can also be used by teachers and educators as a way of measuring a student’s ability without having to impose on them (Griffiths 2002). Grades can demotivate a learner as it usually fosters a high-stress environment which is not ideal in learning. Video games are a way to grade without tarnishing motivation and self-esteem as they often are immersive.

To conclude, although video games are thought of as a bad influence on children and adults alike, they can be used in many educational scenarios as they can help encourage learning, increase productivity, boost morale and much more. Video games are predicted to take over the future of education and are already widely used in many learning environments today.

- Berger, AA 2012, Media and Society: A Critical Perspective, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Lanham, Maryland.

    - Berger is an emeritus professor of broadcast and electronic communication arts at the state university in San Francisco making this source both credible and reliable. He investigates the shaping influence that the consumers and the media have on each other and allows students to become more aware of the media that frequent their lives. It is a good starting point. Seeing as this is ‘a critical perspective’, it exhibits a fair amount of bias but is an academic source as it refers to other sources.

- Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, Innovating with Technology 2011, Research Findings Report 2011, Innovation and Next Practice Division, Melbourne.

    - The state government of Victoria funds this report. It investigates the effect different types of video games have on K-12 students throughout Victoria. They found that the students were more cooperative and more motivated in learning compared to before. The research presents video games as effective learning tools in schooling environments and has given useful information for the essay.

    - This article examines the impact shooter games have on the brain. Green got his PhD in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester. Bavelier got hers from MIT in Boston and was a professor at the University of Rochester but is currently working at the University of Geneva. Since they are both associated with notable universities, this source is reliable and credible. Bavelier also did a TED talk on ‘Your brain on video games’, displaying findings from various studies she has partaken in including this one. It gave relevant information for the essay. Contains little to no bias.

    - Griffiths is a professor specialising in behavioural addictions at Nottingham Trent University, which increases this source’s reliability and credibility. In the article, he explores the possibility of educating through video games and is meant to inspire the development of games that may be used in educational settings. It provided great arguments for the essay which helped in kickstarting research. There is very little bias in this source.
