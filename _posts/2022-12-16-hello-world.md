Welcome to Preonbox! A place where anything and everything is possible - figuratively speaking. 

Hi, I'm Janelle Mallari. I'm a self-appointed professional dabbler specialising in software dev. If you couldn't tell by now, I am passionate about learning new things. The type of things, however, depends entirely on my mood. This website was developed by me for me mainly. It helps me gather the thoughts swimming around in my head. It also provides a space to showcase and log what I've created and learned for all to see.

There are two main aspects to Preonbox: my projects and my blog. I'm working on various projects at the moment. One of which ([Pivot]({{ site.baseurl }}/pivot)) has been deployed at the time of writing this. For more information about my projects, click on the projects tab or this [link]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects). The plan for the blog is to brain-dump anything that has caught my attention in that particular fortnight. It could be about anything from Coding to Art to Finance. Why a fortnight and not a week? I choose to publish fortnightly because of two things: 1. I want to have time for my other hobbies and to spend time with my family and friends, and 2. In my opinion, a week is not enough time for creating and editing quality posts. Two weeks should be fine. Of course, publishing times vary depending on the scope of the topic and my current workload.
