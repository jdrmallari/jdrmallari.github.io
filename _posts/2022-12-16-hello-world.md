Welcome to Preonbox! A place where anything and everything is possible - figuratively speaking. 

Hi, I'm Janelle Mallari. I'm a self-appointed professional dabbler specialising in software dev. If you couldn't tell by now, I am passionate about learning new things. The type of things, however, depends entirely on my mood. This website was developed by me for me mainly. It helps me gather the thoughts swimming around in my head. It also provides a space to showcase and log what I've created and learned for all to see.

There are two main aspects to Preonbox: my projects and personal blog. I'm working on various projects at the moment one of which (Pivot) has been deployed at the time of writing this. The plan for the blog is to brain-dump anything that has caught my attention in that particular fortnight. It could literally be about anything from Coding to Art to Finance. Why a fortnight and not a week? I choose to publish fortnightly because of two things: 1. I have a life. and 2. In my opinion, a week is not enough time for creating and editing quality posts. Two weeks should be enough. Of course, publishing times vary depending on the scope of the topic.
