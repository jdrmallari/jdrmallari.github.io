Video games are a relatively new form of media that has gained popularity amongst the general population since its inception, especially with the youth. However, they are often associated with problems such as desensitisation, encouraging antisocial behaviour and are seen as a source of distraction for individuals. Despite these negative connotations, several studies indicate that video games can foster a wide range of cognitive abilities, inspire, increase well-being, and provide immediate rewards. They are also fun and interactive in contrast to other forms of media. Many of their positive attributes give video games educational potential.

Playing video games, particularly shooter games, can help develop cognitive skills. A study created by Green (2006) shows that shooter games compared to other game genres can boost brain power in those who have never played or have little experience with these action games. Skills such as more accurate attention allocation, improved hand-eye coordination, and better vision are present in gamers compared to non-gamers. Bavelier, Green’s lab partner, also spoke about this in her TED talk: "Your brain on video games." She states that despite conventional beliefs that video games can ruin eyesight and diminish intelligence, research shows that they can boost cognitive capacity and even improve vision, which are some of the catalysts for learning.

Video game fixation has increased during the past decade, which has been a cause for concern for many people. However, it is not necessarily a bad thing because this shows that video games can be a motivator in school settings. They incorporate play and fun, which may lead to greater intrinsic motivation. Various motivation studies conducted in real-life settings show that play, fun, and autonomy are excellent promoters of productivity. The Research Findings Report (2011) by the state government of Victoria trialled three types of video games - serious games, virtual worlds (Quest Atlantis), and puzzle games - on primary and secondary students across Victoria. In all strands, students were found to be more cooperative and motivated to learn. This demonstrates that integrating video games into education systems can increase a student's drive to learn.

One archetypal image of a gamer is a person hunched in front of a screen all day and never goes outside to socialise. Yet, video games are a common pastime for the masses. If video games are frequent in everyday life, they can be a great topic to include in conversations with friends, colleagues, or strangers. School - as well as a place for gaining knowledge - is a place for socialisation. Socialisation enables information to be passed from one person to another. The research report by the state government of Victoria shows that there has been an increase in collaboration among peers after the introduction of video games in their curriculum. Video games have social benefits which facilitate an exchange of knowledge and ideas amongst peers.

Several researchers use video games to measure abilities, self-esteem, and more to help them with their experiments. Teachers and educators can utilise them to measure a student's ability without imposition (Griffiths 2002). Grades can demotivate a learner as it usually breeds a high-stress environment that is not ideal for learning. Video games are often immersive and can be used to assess without impairing motivation and morale.

In conclusion, video games can be a valuable tool in educational settings as they promote learning, boost productivity, cultivate self-esteem, and much more. They are predicted to take over the future of education and are already widely used in many learning environments today.

- Berger, AA 2012, Media and Society: A Critical Perspective, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Lanham, Maryland.

    - Berger is an emeritus professor of broadcast and electronic communication arts at the state university in San Francisco making this source both credible and reliable. He investigates the shaping influence that the consumers and the media have on each other and allows students to become more aware of the media that frequent their lives. It is a good starting point. Seeing as this is ‘a critical perspective’, it exhibits a fair amount of bias but is an academic source as it refers to other sources.

- Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, Innovating with Technology 2011, Research Findings Report 2011, Innovation and Next Practice Division, Melbourne.

    - The state government of Victoria funds this report. It investigates the effect different types of video games have on K-12 students throughout Victoria. They found that the students were more cooperative and more motivated in learning compared to before. The research presents video games as effective learning tools in schooling environments and has given useful information for the essay.

    - This article examines the impact shooter games have on the brain. Green got his PhD in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester. Bavelier got hers from MIT in Boston and was a professor at the University of Rochester but is currently working at the University of Geneva. Since they are both associated with notable universities, this source is reliable and credible. Bavelier also did a TED talk on ‘Your brain on video games’, displaying findings from various studies she has partaken in including this one. It gave relevant information for the essay. Contains little to no bias.

    - Griffiths is a professor specialising in behavioural addictions at Nottingham Trent University, which increases this source’s reliability and credibility. In the article, he explores the possibility of educating through video games and is meant to inspire the development of games that may be used in educational settings. It provided great arguments for the essay which helped in kickstarting research. There is very little bias in this source.
